## About Me

![](/dia-thesis-delhi.jpeg)

I'm an Architect at [DDIR Architecture Studio](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ddir-architecture-studio/) working with [Dominic Dube](https://www.instagram.com/dominicdube.2260/?hl=en). I graduated from RV College of Architecture with a Bachelors in Architecture. Architecture continually motivates me to strive for excellence, embrace innovation, and wholeheartedly appreciate intricate details. I am particularly captivated by Sustainable Architecture and the exploration of novel concepts, which constantly drive me to expand my knowledge, adapt, and continually improve.

You can get an overview of the work I do from my portfolio hosted [here](https://issuu.com/dia_vohra/docs/diavohra).
