## About Dia Vohra

![](/dia.jpeg)

I'm a Junior Architect at [DDIR Architecture Studio](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ddir-architecture-studio/) working with [Dominic Dube](https://www.instagram.com/dominicdube.2260/?hl=en). I graduated from RV College of Architecture with a Bachelors in Architecture. Architecture continually motivates me to strive for excellence, embrace innovation, and wholeheartedly appreciate intricate details. I am particularly captivated by Sustainable Architecture and the exploration of novel concepts, which constantly drive me to expand my knowledge, adapt, and continually improve.
