A 5th year student pursuing her Bachelors in Architecture at RV College of Architecture. Architecture has always inspired me to do better, be innovative, observe, learn, and pay attention to the details. Sustainable Architecture and new concepts in architecture fascinate me and push me to explore, adapt and do better.
